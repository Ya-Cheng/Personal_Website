            <p class="mb-5">Hi! My name is Ya-Cheng. Kelly is my preferred name. I lived in 
            Taoyuan, a thriving city in Taiwan, with my parents. Although Taiwan is very small, 
            I love my country, and I am confident to introduce Taiwan's beauty to people whom 
            I meet wherever I go. There are lots of natural landscapes, night markets, delicious 
            food, and many other fun things here - I hope you have the opportunity to 
            visit Taiwan!</p>
			<p></p>
			<p class="mb-5">Besides that, I have a really 
				big family. I have several uncles, aunts, and cousins, and we often meet together and have meals 
				during weekends or holidays. It's always nice to have these reunions because we maintain our 
				kind relationships and the warmth among individuals. Being a CS girl, my goal is to become a skilled SWE. I'm adept at coding languages such as C++, Java, Python, and 
				web programming languages HTML and CSS. Moreover, I am interested in AIoT, AI, and backend development, and I am 
				passionate in music especially piano.</p>

            <h6 class="title mb-4">Academics</h6>
            <p class="mb-5">I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), with over three years of experience in programming and teaching. I am set to serve as a Course Assistant for CS128 (Intro to Programming II), where I will support students in understanding advanced C++ concepts and programming structures. I hold international certifications including the Microsoft Technology Associate (Java) and the Information Technology Specialist (Python), and I am proficient in C++, Java, Python, and HTML. I also have solid experience with version control using GitHub, API integration, and AIoT development on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform.</p>
			<p></p>	
			<p class="mb-5">In my previous projects, I collaborated with graduate students from Chang Gung University to develop a smart wheelchair system using edge computing and AIoT architecture. I also co-developed nonprofit platforms and applied generative AI technologies to build interactive web applications. My research interests lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence and educational technology. I am currently exploring applications in image recognition, natural language processing, and embedded systems. I hope to contribute to interdisciplinary research teams that bridge theory and practice while expanding the real-world impact of technology.</p>

These opportunities not only enriched my academic journey but also shaped me into a more well-rounded and proactive individual.</p>

        <h3 class="card-title">Jul. - Aug. 2022 Summer</h3>
            
            <p class="mb-5">This summer, I participated in Boston University’s High School Honors Program. 
				In fact, the HSH program is the longest program among all BU’s summer programs, and the 
				dorm was always a huge combination of students from different programs including internship, 
				dancing, and science-research programs. I had seen so many interesting things, met a variety 
				of people, and gained numerous cool experiences that would never be erased from my memories. </p>
				
			<div>
			<span id="text"><p class="mb-5">Boston is a fascinating city. The weather is never rainy, the daytime is much longer 
				than the daytime in Taiwan, the air is dry and cool, and the atmosphere is so leisurely that 
				I even doubted Boston as a “city”. Most of the buildings and residences are much older than 
				normal cities, but they somehow conserved their own culture and beauty. Generally, Boston is 
				separated into downtown Boston in the southeast region and the school regions; Boston University 
				is located in Western Boston, whereas Harvard and MIT are located in the north of the Charles River. 
				For preparation, the first thing when my father and I arrived in Boston was to get familiar with 
				Boston’s Train system (people in Boston called it “T”), which was a clever decision because the 
				Train was also the main transportation in BU and it would be very convenient to get to anywhere 
				after I moved into BU’s dorm. Besides all of that, one thing that made me suffer for the first 
				two weeks was the Americans’ value of distance. The average distance among buildings where I had 
				classes and meals was roughly 20 to 25 minutes walk, which was especially difficult for me who is 
				living in a country where everything is about a 5 minute walk.  I was even tricked by my roommates 
				when I was searching for Target in the university for the first time; they told me that it was a 
				ten minute walk, but actually it took me almost 30 minutes to get there! Thus, I realized how 
				important the Train was within the large BU campus (and it is free for BU students to take the Train).</p>
			
			<p class="mb-5">For the summer program, I took two computer science courses: Introduction to Programming, 
				which is mainly about coding with Python, and the Introduction to Web Programming. 
				Both of the courses were substantial and fulfilling, and the professors and TAs were 
				extremely friendly and helpful to us. During office hours, I often discuss with my 
				classmates and the professor about my assignments and class materials. This not only 
				increased my efficiency on doing assignments, but also gave me chances to listen to 
				stories from those college students (who really studied CS at BU for semesters). They 
				all have unique backgrounds, personalities and different stories and reasons for coming 
				to BU. However, they were all surprised to know my age, since according to most of them, 
				they didn’t even begin to learn coding until their senior year at high school, and one BU 
				junior didn’t even have his own computer when he was at my age. All in all, they encouraged 
				me to keep my initial goal and motivation because computer science is never a joyful path. 
				It is their positiveness that helps them to go through those harsh processes and competitions.</p>
			<p class="mb-5">Boston University is a friendly and diverse community. On my floor of the dorm, there 
				were classmates from other US states, Europe, India, China, and even Korea, and I was actually 
				the only student from Taiwan within the entire HSH summer program. Nevertheless, this diversity 
				did not hinder our interactions. Although we all have different cultures, religions, backgrounds, 
				and values, all of us were willing to share our past experiences and the things we learned from our 
				own courses or research. By the end of the six weeks, I became best friends with a few Asian 
				students from Shenzhen and Los Angeles, and a girl from Portugal. We are still keeping in touch 
				and sharing fun things in our daily lives.</p>
